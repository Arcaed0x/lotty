# Lotty

A small responsive lot size calculator React app built with Next that uses: [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), [Font Awesome (v4)](https://fontawesome.com/v4/), [Animate.css](https://animate.style/), [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/), [NanoId](https://zelark.github.io/nano-id-cc/), [Zod](zod.dev). This application took me two days to build.

## Why?
I saw that many retail traders struggle when calculating the lot size of their indices positions and at times they want variable risk in there trades where their stop size is the same but the risk amount is different. I thought to make a small app that would all traders to model their account and then view a table with their position sizes already calculated.

## How to run the app?

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the app running.

# Design decisions

## Bulma (CSS Library)
As I was looking to build this app quickly I went for something simple and familiar and gave all interactivity decisions to me in React.

## pnpm (Node package manager)
I selected pnpm for it's speed as well as similarity to Yarn which I used in the past and enjoyed. The performance of installs was a game changer. So it was a no brainer to add


## Font Awesome (CSS Icon library)
This was recommend by the Bulma and thus was the simplest to develop with. A simple import in the head of the app.

## Animate.CSS (CSS Animation library)
I thought this would be a nice extra touch to make the application more lively and fun to use. 

## Zustand (React state management)
While developing this application I found that I kept on drilling props down too much in my app which made things harder to maintain so I added a little global state with Zustand. I chose Zustand because it had very little boilerplate and was simple to use from the docs.

## NanoId (Id Generator)
I used this library to mimic IDs that would be generated by a database to identify certain objects. I chose it because it was quick and small too. 


## Zod (Data validation)
Zod was used for the validation of form data and also the validation of state too. The docs make it quick, simple and type safe to validate my state before saving it.

## How I would expand this app further...
- [x] Add storage of Risk Profiles into localStorage
- [ ] Add backend with integration to forex apis.
- [ ] Add authentication and database so risk profiles can be accessed from anywhere.
